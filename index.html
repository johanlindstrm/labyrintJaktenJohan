<!-------------------------------
 * First javascript app project by Johan Lindström
 * "Labyrint Jakten" is a 2d maze game with a simple goal reach the end!
 * In the code you will find out how I Draw my gameMap, player and enemy.
 * Make the player move using your arrow keys or the button displayed on screen!
 * This app is easy to expand into a bigger project, simply create more tiles with different functions, how about a teleporter or maybe some power ups??
 *
 * It can easily be scaled down/up by changing the mapW, mapH, tileW and tileH.
 * Also edit the width and height of the canvas to make sure everything fits the screen.
